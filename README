Hexagonal Address Aggregate Scheme (HAAS)
---

This contains the lab software implementation for the HAAS address instruction
set and storage structure. This is intended to be high level software which
gives a set of intrinsics and operators which are implemented in some unknown
fashion. A software reference implementation is given.

In general, the work is largely derived from the Hexagonal Image Processing
book (ISBN: 978-1-4471-5884-4), and much credit is due for the starting point
given by the theoretical treatment of the book. This library supports a machine
vision project for recognition and reconstruction of geometric cues with a
greater degree of efficiency and accuracy than is possible on a rectangular
sample lattice.

As of the time of this writing, the documentation is internal. Source code
documentation is in progress. I confess I haven't had time to look at getting a
single documentation file generated. Currently, it generates a tree of files,
which can make navigation a pain and the search function is close to useless.
